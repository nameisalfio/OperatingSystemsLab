# Operating Systems Laboratory Lectures

## Overview

This repository contains the material for the laboratory lectures of the Operating Systems course.

The entire course will be structured around the topic of Threads Posix and will include lessons that, in an incremental manner, aim to grasp the whole concept of threads in the Unix environment. The course provides the necessary knowledge to understand the basic concepts of threads, the synchronization mechanisms, and the communication between threads. The course will also cover the use of threads in the context of the Unix operating system.

In order for the entire course to be properly addressed, one needs an operating system Linux-based to be able to compile and run exercises. Particularly, the operating system is necessary to use libraries and tools that are not available on Windows or MacOS like 'semaphore.h', 'linux/limits.h', ecc...

## Structure

The course is divided into 3 parts:

- Lectures: The practical lessons wich incrementally introduce the concepts of Posix Threads.
- Practice: The practice exercises that will be carried out during the laboratory lectures.
- Exams: The past exams of the academic year 2023/24 that will be used as a reference for the final exam.
